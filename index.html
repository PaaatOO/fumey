  <h2>
    Welcome to the Urban Pollution Visualisation web service.</h2>
<p>
This application was implemented by Patrick McCluskey as part of a ten-week Master's project in
Computer Science at the University of Newcastle.<br><br>

The service is intended to run persistently on your monitor, so that you will be aware
of the current pollution levels in certain areas of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.<br>
It allows you to visualise in the urban space those areas which are dangerous either
from Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)  or Carbon Monoxide (CO).<br>
By default, the web service will refresh automatically every 2
minutes so that you can see the current situation as it happens.<br>
This option can be unchecked to allow more in-depth study of one particular set of data.<br><br>

The data is assembled from the live data feeds of the <a href = "http://uoweb1.ncl.ac.uk/">Urban Observatory</a>.<br>
The data is colour coded into a traffic-light system for danger to humans from the levels shown. Clicking on the plotted points will reveal their specific value.<br>
If desired, only red (dangerous) levels will be plotted on the map, by checking the relevant box.
